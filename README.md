(WIP) For getting information of Japanese Kanji characters by hovering or by screenshot.  
AKA JP-CapToEN.

# Plan:

1. Train and improve a Japanese OCR model using TensorFlow
2. Connect model to a UI either made in QT or PyQT
3. Allow predictions to bring up other dictionary information about the characters / words.
