(WIP) Learning about and creating a motion capture algorithm that maps
movement to another character's movement through a camera.

# Plan:
1. (2/10) Find papers, examples, and learn about each algorithm that goes into mocap software.
2. (2/16) Train/test/evaluate my own model in python.
3. (2/24) Build a small application with it in Flask/Django/AWS/Mongo/Spark
4. (3/14) Rebuild the complete model in C++
5. (3/21) Complete the desktop application with AWS/Mongo/Spark/QT
