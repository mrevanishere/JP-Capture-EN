# live-mocha
(WIP) Learning about and creating a motion capture algorithm that maps
movement to another character's movement through a camera.

# Plan:
1. (3/1) Find papers, examples, and learn about each algorithm that goes into mocap software.
2. (4/1) Train/test/evaluate my own model in python.
3. Build a small application with it in Flask/Django/AWS/Mongo/Spark
4. Rebuild the complete model in C++
5. Complete the desktop application with AWS/Mongo/Spark/QT
