# Mocha - Motion Capture
(WIP) Learning about and creating a motion capture algorithm that maps
movement to another character's movement through a camera.

# Plan:
1. (Present-4/30) Build Full-Stack MERN App on AWS and Spark
2. (5/1-5/31) Find papers, examples, and learn about each algorithm that goes into mocap software, train in PyTorch/Spark
3. (6/1-6/30) Rebuild the complete model in C++ for embedded (embedded-mocha)
